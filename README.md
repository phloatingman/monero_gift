Monero Gift is a printable template for people that want to easily give Monero away as a present.

Here's the printable PDF: https://github.com/phloatingman/monero_gift/raw/main/Monero%20Gift.pdf

Note: When you write down the seed phrase, make sure it's in all lower case. Cake Wallet only accepts lowercase words.

I usually use this printable in tandem with an Amazon Gift Card. For example, I would give $50 USD worth of XMR and $50 USD worth of Amazon Gift Card in the same envelope in case my gift receiver does not want anything to do with cryptocurrency.  If the gift receiver does not transfer the funds to their own wallet within 1 year, the funds can be swept and regifted.
