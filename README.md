Monero Gift is a printable template for people that want to easily give Monero away as a present.

Here's the printable PDF: https://github.com/phloatingman/monero_gift/raw/main/Monero%20Gift.pdf

Here's the source file if you want to make changes: https://github.com/phloatingman/monero_gift/raw/main/Monero%20Gift.ai

Note: When you write down the seed phrase, make sure it's in all lower case. Monero.com wallet only accepts lowercase words.

I usually use this printable in tandem with an Amazon Gift Card. For example, I would give $50 worth of XMR and $50 worth Amazon Gift Card in the same envelope in case my gift receiver does not want anything to do with cryptocurrency.
